I've decided to start writing about my experiments with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

So far, I've done a series of challenges that can be found in the [Elm Challenges](https://github.com/pdamoc/elmChallenges) repository. Challenge 5, a snake clone, can be seen running [here](http://pdamoc.github.io/elmChallenges/).


# Elm Docset

I've created a series of [python scripts](https://github.com/pdamoc/elm-docset) that crawl the Elm's packages documentation and generate a [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) docset. The last generated docset can be downloaded through Dash's Preference pane from User Contributed section.
